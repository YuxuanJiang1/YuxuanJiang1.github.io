About me
======
Hi, I'm __Yuxuan Jiang(江宇轩)__. [\[CV\]](https://github.com/YuxuanJiang1/yuxuanjiang1.github.io/blob/master/files/resume_phd(1).pdf))  
I am a first-year Ph.D student of Computer Science in University of Maryland at Baltimore, advised by Prof.[Frank Ferraro](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~ferraro/). I recieved my Master's degree in Computer Science from the New York University in 2023, where I was advised by 
Prof.[Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io/) and Prof.[He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/).    

My interests are in natural language processing and machine learning. I am particularity interested in Story Understanding with LLMs.
