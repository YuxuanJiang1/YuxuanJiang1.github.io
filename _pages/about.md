About me
======
Hi, I'm __Yuxuan Jiang(江宇轩)__. [\[CV\]](https://github.com/YuxuanJiang1/yuxuanjiang1.github.io/blob/master/files/resume_yuxuanjiang.pdf))  
I am a second-year Master of Computer Science student in New York University Courant Institute, advised by Dr.[Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io/) and Prof.[He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/). Prior to NYU, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information System from The Beijing Lang. and Culture university and was supervised by Prof.Erhong Yang and Prof.[Liner Yang](https://tianlinyang.github.io/index_en.html).    

My interests are in natural language processing and machine learning. I am particularity interested in natural language understanding and natural language generation. 
I'm now doing some research on question answering and controllable text generation.
